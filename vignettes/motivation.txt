It seems that this article fits both "comparisons and benchmarking" and "add-on packages" types.  The article introduces the problem of weighted random sampling without replacement, and describes and analyzes various implementations, available in the wrswoR package, for which the base R implementation is very slow.  Two of the implementations described use a recent approach for which no reusable implementation seems to be available yet.  The analysis demonstrates performance characteristics and correctness of the implementation.
