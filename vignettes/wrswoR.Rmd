# Introduction

Random sampling is one of the basic primitives in statistical computing.
\fxwarning{Used where?}

This paper focuses on a specific variant: sampling without replacement from a finite population
with nonuniform probability distribution.

First, different techniques for sampling from discrete distributions are reviewed.
Several implementations for sampling without replacement are discussed,
this includes evaluation of correctness and runtime performance.
The paper concludes with suggestions for incorporating the findings into base
\proglang{R}.

# Description of the statistical technique

# Explanation of the code

# Code

# Examples

# From template

## Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

## R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
