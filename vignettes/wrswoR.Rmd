# Introduction

Random sampling is one of the basic primitives in statistical computing.
\fxwarning{Used where?}

This paper focuses on a specific variant: sampling without replacement from a finite population
with non-uniform probability distribution.
\fxwarning{Application?}

First, different techniques for sampling from discrete populations are reviewed.
Several implementations for sampling without replacement are discussed,
this includes evaluation of correctness and runtime performance.
The paper concludes with suggestions for incorporating the findings into base
\proglang{R}.


# Sampling from discrete populations

We use \cref{alg:sample} as a definition of sampling from discrete populations
with or without replacement from arbitrary (including uniform) probability distributions.
From this definition, the following can be observed:

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{$\text{sample}(n, s, \text{replace}, p_i)$}
  \label{alg:sample}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE $n$: Size of the population
    \REQUIRE $s$: Number of items to sample
    \REQUIRE $\text{replace}$: \TRUE{} to request sampling with replacement
    \REQUIRE $p_i$: Relative probability of each item for $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$
    \ENSURE Returns a vector $x_j \in \{1,\ldots,n\} $ with
      $j \in \{1,\ldots,s\}$ that contains the indexes of the items sampled
    \IF{$s = 0$}
      \RETURN vector of length 0
    \ENDIF
    \STATE Randomly select $k$ so that $\mathrm{P}(k=i) = \frac{p_k}{\sum_{j}p_j}$
      for all $i$ \label{alg:sample:norm}
    \IF{not replace}\label{alg:sample:if}
      \STATE $n \leftarrow n - 1$
      \STATE remove item $k$ from $p_i$
    \ENDIF
    \RETURN $k \oplus \text{sample}(n, s - 1, \text{replace}, p_i)$
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

- Sampling with replacement appears to be a simpler problem than sampling without
  replacement, as the block starting at line \ref{alg:sample:if} is not required.
- If all probabilities $p_i$ are equal, the selection probability $\mathrm{P}(i=k)$
  of the sampled items in line \ref{alg:sample:norm} always equals $\frac{1}{n}$
  and does not have to be computed explicitly.

In this framework, sampling without replacement with non-uniform probabilities
is the hardest problem.
This intuition carries over to the more specialized algorithms that implement
each case.


## With replacement

The *with replacement* case corresponds to repeated selection of $k$ from *the same*
discrete probability distribution.
The uniform case can be implemented easily by scaling and discretizing the
output of a random number generator.
More work is needed in the non-uniform case.
Assuming w.l.o.g.\ $\sum_j p_j = n$,
it is possible to construct (in $O(n)$ time) a subdivision
$(l_i, r_i, s_i)$ with $i, l_i, r_i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$
and $0 < s_i \leq 1$ so that $$p_i = \sum_{j:l_j=i}{s_j} + \sum_{j:r_j=i}{(1-s_j)}$$
\fxwarning{Cite Walker's alias method}.
(Figuratively speaking, the probability mass given by $p_i$
is distributed over $n$ boxes so that each box $i$ "contains" at most two items
$l_i$ and $r_i$, and the share occupied by item $l_i$ in box $i$ is given by $s_i$.
Each item can be distributed over several boxes.)


## Without replacement

In the *without replacement* case, each selected item is removed from the
collection of candidate items.
Again, the uniform case is much simpler.
An unordered array of size $n$, initialized with the natural sequence,
can be used for storing the candidate items.
The selection of the item corresponds to choosing an index at random in this
unordered array.
Removal of an item with known index can be done in $O(1)$ time.

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

## R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.
