\title{Weighted sampling without replacement using reservoir sampling
 (Rcpp version, using C++ vectors)}
\value{
An integer vector of length \code{size} with elements from
 \code{1:n}.
}
\description{
\code{sample.int.ccrank} takes a sample of the specified
 \code{size} from the elements of \code{1:n} without replacement.
 This function is faster than \code{sample.int} in many cases,
 especially when \code{n} and \code{size} are large, even if the
 weights range over many orders of magnitudes.
}
\details{
The call \code{sample.int.ccrank(n, size, prob)} is equivalent
 to \code{sample.int(n, size, replace=F, prob)}.  (The results will
 most probably be different for the same random seed, but the
 returned samples are distributed identically for both calls.)
 However, \code{sample.int} implements an algorithm with quadratic
 runtime -- this is not suitable for large values of \code{n} and
 \code{size} (see also
 \url{http://stackoverflow.com/q/15113650/946850}).  (Note that the
 performance of \code{sample.int} is just fine in the "with
 replacement" case, and also for uniform probabilities.)

 This function implements a variant of reservoir sampling. It can be
 shown that the order statistic of U^(1/w_i) has the same
 distribution as random sampling without replacement (U=uniform (0,1)
 distribution). To increase numerical stability, log(U) / w_i is
 computed instead; the log transform does not change the order
 statistic.

\examples{
s <- sample.int.ccrank(200000, 100000, runif(200000))
stopifnot(unique(s) == s)
p <- c(995, rep(1, 5))
n <- 1000
set.seed(42)
stopifnot(abs(table(replicate(sample.int.ccrank(6, 3, p), n=n)) / n -
  c(1, rep(0.4, 5))) < 0.04)
